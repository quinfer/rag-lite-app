Tutorial: Querying PDFs with RAG-lite

Step 1: Understand the Goal
The RAG-lite app allows you to extract and query information from PDF documents. By uploading financial reports or trading documents, you can retrieve specific insights based on your queries.

Step 2: Access the App

Open the app link provided by your instructor. For example: https://huggingface.co/spaces/<your_space_name>
Step 3: Explore the Preloaded Documents

Download the sample PDFs provided:
Fake Financial Report
Fake Trading Document
Upload one of these documents in the app's "Upload PDF" field.
Step 4: Ask Your First Query

In the text box, type a question about the uploaded document. For example:
What is the net profit for Global Corp in Q4? (Financial Report)
What is the trading strategy for TrendTracker? (Trading Document)
Step 5: Interpret the Results

The app will return the most relevant text snippets from the document. Verify if the answer aligns with the content.
Step 6: Experiment with Your Own PDFs

Try uploading other PDFs (within size limits). These could include research papers, market reports, or personal study material.
Step 7: Advanced Exploration (Optional)

For students with coding experience, download the app’s source code and run it locally. Customise the chunking size, embeddings, or database backend to see how it affects retrieval.
3. Features to Include in the App
Preloaded PDFs: Add links to the financial report and trading document directly in the app interface for easy access.
Query Suggestions: Provide example questions in the query box to guide new users.
Instructions Panel: Include a brief "How to Use" section directly on the app’s home screen.
